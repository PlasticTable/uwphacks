Git is a technology (software). It's local. You can access it via command line.
It's used for version control (better than renaming files to version control).

Git commands:
git config --global user.name "Name Here" (enter name)
git config --global user.email "email@address.ca" (enter email)
git config --list (to see the information you typed in)

can use cd and mkdir to move directory and make one
git init is to initialize an empty git repository

git remote -v connecting from wires. Wires as in connect remote respocitory to a local one. It connects Git to GitHub.

To add a file in your git repository
touch "filename"  
git add "filename"  -- to commit the added file into the repository

for windows, go to cmd and go the your desired directory. Once there, type echo. > "filename.text" to create a file (can be any extension)

git status shows files committed to the respository
