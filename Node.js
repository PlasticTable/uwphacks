What is node?
// javascript is a really bad language but it's the only programming language that your browser will understand
// develop servers with javascript using node.js

// Languages made completely related to javascript and it's a server-side language
// It's easy and it's modular
// Great way to build modern websites using javascript on the client and server side

// Node is single-threaded - can only run one thing at one time (one chain of execution you can't have multiple processes at a time)
// Can be used for anything

// Event driven javascript means something that happens that leads to something else
